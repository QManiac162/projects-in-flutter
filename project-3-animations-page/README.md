Flutter is great at enabling developers to quickly create new user interfaces iteratively using the combination of hot reload and declarative UI. However, there comes a time when you need to add additional interactivity to an interface. These touches can be as simple as animating a button on hover or as dramatic as a shader that warps the user interface using the power of the GPU.


This app as the name suggests generates initial menu page for a **post apocalyptic sci-fi** themed game. There is a title with a fragment shader that samples the text to visually animate it, a difficulty menu that changes the color theme of the page with animations galore, and an animated orb painted with a second fragment shader. If that isn't enough, at the end of the codelab you'll add a subtle particle effect to bring movement and interest to the page!
